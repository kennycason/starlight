The wipes aren't too goopy, like Lysol Wipes, and don't rip as easily as Lysol Wipes. Clorox Wipes sometimes shift in the container, so when you go to open them for the first time and draw out the first wipe, it can be difficult to locate, because the center hole sometimes closes (because the wipes fold together), and another area of the roll opens. Once you have the the first wipe through the dispenser opening, it's difficult to get just one out for the first three or four; they all come out at the same time, creating a bulky struggle to get them out of the opening. After that, they come out much easier, but you still can easily draw out too many at once. Once you reach the last few wipes, you get the problem that you had at the beginning, with two to four of the wipes coming out at once.

cd26713a4c44ec36d54234fe832de199,Amazon,E-Commerce,2009-10-24T00:00:00.000-05:00,"Great product, annoying dispenser","I've been purchasing this product for years, but only since last Nov from Amazon (best price around!). This product along with microfibre towels have completely eliminated all other cleaning products from my home. I trust the Clorox name and find new uses for these towelettes all the time.Use in the bathroom and kitchen is a no brainer - from countertops, tables, sinks, ranges, frig/freezer, to spills on the floor, rain/mud spatters from the dogs coming in from the rain/snow. I even use them as hand sanitizers when in a hurry (or lazy) and don't want to hike to the bathroom for the hand sanitizer. I especially like them for the glass shower doors - wet enough to wash the doors well and then use microfiber towel (with NO elbow grease) and they sparkle like new. While they aren't great on mirrors (they do streak), I've used them for that also and then just microfibered the mirror dry. No streaks or that fogging appearance.I agree that the dispenser is, well, to be nice I'll use the term 'annoying'. The first several (with me it is more like 6-10) wasted wipes just trying to separate the first one from the center of the roll. In transit, they flop into one another and finding that first, crucial wipe to pull through the 'saloon door' type dispenser clips can take about 10 minutes if you are patient. I'm not. When I want a wipe, I want a wipe. So, off comes the lid, I insert a pencil (eraser side first) hope I'm in the exact center, press the eraser against the wipe and press/pull upward. It does work, but I don't always get the very center of the roll the first time around. Once THAT chore is done, the saloon door type clips NEVER stay together. One side is always dipping into the canister, so getting just one wipe often takes 2 hands - I've wasted so much time playing around trying to keep the two saloon doors closed so the wipe pulls through their center just one at a time...no more. If I get more than one wipe, I just stuff it back inside to be used later.All in all, I like this product and will continue using it regardless of the crazy dispenser. It is the product I want, not the container. To be fair, I've used an assortment of baby wipes in the past that have ridiculous dispensers also - havent' found one yet that dispenses just one at a time unless it is the refill where I must lift the label/tab off the opening and then reseal it. And even that takes two hands.The clorox wipes are wet enough to do the job; any job and don't drip or dibble until perhaps the last 3-4 in the canister that are a bit too wet, but after using this product for a while, I'm used to that.

I used to use a brush and dustpan to first clean up the crate-laden sand, dirt and grit, then spray cleaners with sponges, towels, etc. Now, I remove the bedding for the laundry, crawl into the crate with 2-3 wipes and in less than 2 minutes the entire crate is clean, sanitized and smells nice, all ready for the clean bedding.

a0cf34c1fa3e809f92e70008eecf971f,Amazon,E-Commerce,2010-01-10T00:00:00.000-06:00,Love the product; annoying dispenser could use facelift,"I've been purchasing this product for years, but only since November '08 from Amazon (best price around!). This product along with microfibre towels have completely eliminated all other cleaning products from my home. I trust the Clorox name and find new uses for these towelettes all the time.Use in the bathroom and kitchen is a no brainer - from countertops, tables, sinks, ranges, frig/freezer, to spills on the floor, rain/mud spatters from the dogs coming in from the rain/snow. I even use them as hand sanitizers when in a hurry (or lazy) and don't want to hike to the bathroom for the hand sanitizer. I especially like them for the glass shower doors - wet enough to wash the doors well and then use microfiber towel (with NO elbow grease) and they sparkle like new. While they aren't great on mirrors (they do streak), I've used them for that also and then just microfibered the mirror dry. No streaks or that fogging appearance.I agree that the dispenser is, well, to be nice I'll use the term 'annoying'. The first several (with me it is more like 6-10) wasted wipes just trying to separate the first one from the center of the roll. In transit, they flop into one another and finding that first, crucial wipe to pull through the 'saloon door' type dispenser clips can take about 10 minutes if you are patient. I'm not. When I want a wipe, I want a wipe. So, off comes the lid, I insert a pencil (eraser side first) hope I'm in the exact center, press the eraser against the wipe and press/pull upward. It does work, but I don't always get the very center of the roll the first time around. Once THAT chore is done, the saloon door type clips NEVER stay together. One side is always dipping into the canister, so getting just one wipe often takes 2 hands - I've wasted so much time playing around trying to keep the two saloon doors closed so the wipe pulls through their center just one at a time...no more. If I get more than one wipe, I just stuff it back inside to be used later.All in all, I like this product and will continue using it regardless of the crazy dispenser. It is the product I want, not the container. To be fair, I've used an assortment of baby wipes in the past that have ridiculous dispensers also - havent' found one yet that dispenses just one at a time unless it is the refill where I must lift the label/tab off the opening and then reseal it. And even that takes two hands.The clorox wipes are wet enough to do the job; any job and don't drip or dibble until perhaps the last 3-4 in the canister that are a bit too wet, but after using this product for a while, I'm used to that. When I get to the bottom and use the last few wipes, I simply open another canister and pour the extra cleaning solution into the new canister. Figure it can't hurt anything. I use these for cleaning the car, the tires, the wheels, dash, a/c vents, etc. I also use them for cleaning all my dog crates (12 humongous crates throughout the house as I foster dogs until they find homes and own 7 of my own-all Greyhounds).

Fresh out of the container, the Lysol wipes are a little wetter. To sanitize a surface, leave the surface visibly wet after wiping for thirty seconds. To disinfect use enough wipes to leave a surface wet for four minutes and then allow to dry. This is the regimen that produces a 99.9% kill. We like that the wipes can be used in the bathroom and the kitchen. For surfaces that will come in contact with food a potable water rinse is necessary. For any object or surface that a baby might lick, a potable water rinse is also advised. I prefer using wipes to using a disinfectant spray because of the possibility of inhaling disinfectant. As most people know, bacteria reproduce quickly so any disinfection is temporary. Clorox claims on the canister,"" Disinfects household, kitchen, and bathroom bacteria."" I added the commas. I think Clorox means that the wipes ""disinfect"" surfaces in kitchens and bathrooms, not the bacteria themselves. The lemon and the orange wipes have pleasant scents. Clorox doesn't indicate whether or not the citrus varieties have any additional cleaning properties.",positive,false,spudman,,,Male,none,"Pasadena, MD United States       ",,39.0724,-76.7902,http://www.amazon.com/Clorox-fresh-scent-orange-viruses/product-reviews/B0015UQI4Q/ref=sr_1_205_cm_cr_acr_img?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1,,98.6,,,,,,

I will never put this away without leaving enough of the next towel poking through the dispenser because I can easily pull it up next time. If the towels slip down & you have to retrieve them, it is a wet, goopy affair. It can be done-but watch your knuckles!I will tolerate the dispenser because the towels are great. Terrific solution for cleaning quickly! Wipe down all surfaces in kitchen or bathroom quickly and easily. Great supply from Amazon-no Shipping over $25 all the way to Alaska.They do need to fix that dispenser!!!Fortunately, the new recycling center here takes these #2 containers, so now I do not have to feel guilty about using these anymore. These are great cleaning cloths-they are used everywhere.
